# Problem Statement:

Our client, Supply Deco industires has seen phenominal growth in revenue in the past two years, thanks to it's current customer base which mostly includes wholesalers. As the current leaders in the manufacturing gift-ware business, they are looking to continue their reign by adding some new products to the market and would like to know with which of their customers would likely buy this new product so they can market directly to them. In this day and age, ad spend is extremely high, the client is looking to cut costs where necessary without skipping out on providing value. We here at Coco marketing have been asked to create a customer segmentation algorithim to solve this problem.
