### Overview

We've been tasked to figure out a question on a lot of inquiring minds, especially those of the CollegeBoard and Students alike  who are preparing to go to college the following year.

The question we've been asked to answer is:

***Are Standardaized tests a good measure of how successful a student will be in college?***

***More importantly, should standardized tests be required for college enterance?***

We will attempt to answer these questions with the data available to us. Let's dive in!

### Datasets:

#### Provided Data

I've been giving 6 datasets for this project which are below:

- [2017 SAT Scores](./data/sat_2017.csv)
- [2017 ACT Scores](./data/act_2017.csv)
- [2018 SAT Scores](./data/sat_2018.csv)
- [2018 ACT Scores](./data/act_2018.csv)
- [2019 SAT Scores](./data/sat_2019.csv)
- [2019 ACT Scores](./data/act_2019.csv)

These data give average SAT and ACT scores by state, as well as participation rates for the classes of 2017, 2018, and 2019.

You can see the sources for the SAT data [here](https://blog.collegevine.com/here-are-the-average-sat-scores-by-state/) and [here](https://blog.prepscholar.com/average-sat-scores-by-state-most-recent), and the sources for the ACT data [here](https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-scores-by-state-averages-highs-and-lows) and [here](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/research/reports/act-publications/condition-of-college-and-career-readiness-2017.html). **Make sure you cross-reference your data with your data sources to eliminate any data collection or data entry issues.**

### Cleaning and EDA:

This perhaps took the longest time. I cleaned through all 6 data sets and found interesting correlations between the variables. You can find more on this in the notebook attached

Based on outside research and the data above, my theory that standardized test do very little in terms of perparing a student for college and even being an overall measure of aptitude stands true.

The research I've done also focuses on how an estimated 10 million children in North America suffer with Anxiety and also "16-20% of students have high test anxiety" based on a study that was conducted by the American Test Anxieties Association.

Even Harvard **HARVARD!!** believes that the tests should be optional. They believe the goal of an entrance college application should be less about test score and more about extracurricular activities and interests that a student has. That is what adds diversity to a student body.


When we only evaluate students based on test scores, we narrow in only on a subset of students that can afford test prep, or come from high schools in "wealthier districts" that may have resources that focus on helping their students pass these tests. Whereas someone coming from a less fortunate background may not have these options but can benefit greatly from what that particular college might be able to offer.

### Summary/Conclusions:

***Our data:
While our data has shown us that participation rates have varied from year to year, the states that scored highest and lowest on any given test, it has done very little to prove that "acing" any of these tests is a measure of succeeding in college ***

**I did notice something peculiar with these tests however. With the exception of Georgia, Florida and Hawaii, if a state participated in taking the ACT's then it usually had very low participation on the SAT's and vice versa.**

**Recommendations:**

- I believe that all colleges should adopt an optional model. That is, make either standardized tests optional for students and moreover, put more focus on their backgrounds and what makes them unique.  

- A test score is not an accurate measure of a students intelligence or success. They're have been numerous studies that prove this( one is linked above) . People learn in different ways, therefore we cannot use a standardized score as a gauge for all students.

- If we focus more on a qualitative rather than a quantitative scale, I beleive we can increase diversity levels across each student population in any given college.

Thank you!
